> The two most common opporations that are set in the handler are the set operation and the get operation.

What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?

What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
> One of the benifits of using Proxy is that it enables us to set things for validation, which seems like it can be used for logins and setting passwords on things. We can also keep things private from the user that we dont want them being able to access, this way theres less opportunity for them to minipulate or mess with something the devaloper didnt intend for them to.
