Read Foundations of C# > C# Inheritance and answer the following questions

What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
>Inheritance allows you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes.

How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
> You use : to indicate an inheritance and can then inherit all the non-private members.

How does accessibility affect inheritance?
>When members are inherited, the access specifier for an inherited member may be changed (in the derived class only) depending on the type of inheritance used. Put another way, members that were public or protected in the base class may change access specifiers in the derived class.
