Read Servers with Node/Express > Using Query Parameters and answer the following questions

What is the purpose of a Query String?
>A query string is the portion of a URL where data is passed to a web application and/or back-end database. The reason we need query strings is that the HTTP protocol is stateless by design. For a website to be anything more than a brochure, you need to maintain state (store data). There are a number of ways to do this: On most web servers, you can use something like session state server-side. On the client, you can store via cookies. Or in the URL, you can store data via a query string.

What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
>  ?key=value for more than on parameter you add an & between the params. ?key=value&key=value
