What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
>It helps to increase your visibility and authority, as well as shows you know what youre doing. it can help you stand out in a crown, help you land your first position, highlight areas you thrive in and help you brand yourself.

What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
>An effective portfolio shows people who you are as a software dev allows them to view your work. Putting projects that mean something to you and show off you're skills without distracting from these things is ideal.

What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
>I would include the checkpoint4 because I was terrified when I got it but I am so proud of what I was able to do and how it turned ouot. I love the little extras I added for the looks too. I'd also put Kanban because it was an awesome partner coding experience where I learned a ton and felt so much more comfortable and confident with my skills. I'd also use bugger because that experience taught me a ton and I did some really cool (in my opinion) things with some of the front end functionality that the client sees.
