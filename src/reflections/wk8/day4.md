Afternoon Challenge

Read Working In a Professional Environment > Testing in Vue and answer the following questions

What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
>Unit Testing: Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation (test one part at a time).

Component Testing: Tests vue components that must be mounted to the DOM (either real or virtual) to ensure they are working.

End-To-End (E2E) Testing: Tests what happens when users actually use the application.

What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
> I think that the unit testing is the most helpful. For me the unit testing allows me to build that confidence that the code is working and also pinpoint where it may not be in a way that isnt overwhelming. 

What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
> I'm not really sure about this because I think they all seem very valuable and I wouldnt personally say any of them sound like they arent useful.
