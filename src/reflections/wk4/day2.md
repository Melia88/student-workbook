Read Asynchronous Code > JavaScript Promises and answer the following questions

What are the three states of a Promise?
>Pending: Initial State, before the Promise succeeds or fails
Resolved: Completed Promise
Rejected: Failed Promise

How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
>Promises can have call backs placed on them so they are used to create a more organized code.

What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?
> The .then() method is called after the Promise is resolved(success case). Then we can decide what to do with the resolved Promise.
>The .catch() method is called when the promise gets rejected.
