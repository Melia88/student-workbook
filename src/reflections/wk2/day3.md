## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
> console.log()
  console.error('error.message')
  console.warn('warning!!')


## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
>The elements tab woll allow you to view the HTML/CSS written for that page and it can be very useful when debugging because when debugging you can move through one line of code at a time to see exactly what is happening when the code is being ran. This also allows you to make changes within the elements tab that will go into effect on the page so you can see what it does right away, these changes will not be saved to your code and will be gone upon refresh unless you go into your code and change them there.


## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
> You can debug directly under the source tab and still step through each line of code step by step as well as use break points.
