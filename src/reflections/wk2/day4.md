Daily Challange

## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
> Making a plan before you start coding allows you to save time and gives you the ability to map out your problem and how to solve it/what you need to do.


## How do you find answers when you are stuck?
>One good way to find answers when you are stuck is to do some research. Google is a great resourse for that, however if you dont understand the code then you should use it, even if it fixes your problem.


## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
> My biggest takeaways from the article were that it is really good to plan things out but that there is a point where you can over plan. Also that I shouldnt expect to know everythig and inface if I think I do know everything than Im doing something wrong. I should always question code and if there are other ways to do things and if I need help I need to ask/research. Its good to make mistakes and its good to get error messages because it means I'm making progress and it gives me an idea of what needs to be fixed.
