Day 2

I worked a lot on the server over the weekend and hit a lot of road blocks with postman testing and understanding what they ment. I think I spend too much time and didnt time box as well as I could have on certian things but I did get everthing written out and have way more of the tests passing. Now its just about tweeking to find the right fit for the tests. I was able to move from the server to the client side when I would get too deep and realize I wasnt making any progress so I think Im in an ok spot.
