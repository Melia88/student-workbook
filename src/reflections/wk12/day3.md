Day3

I was pretty stressed today. I had one server test that I just hadent been able to figure out and when I was able to get help It turned out that it was littereally just that I spelled something differently than what the test was expecting, I added an 's'. I spent SO long on that its insane but now its funny since I've gotten it fixed. Im being told that I'm in a good place to pass but I still feel pretty behind. I wanted to accomplish more today but its ok, Im gonna keep pushing and get this done!
