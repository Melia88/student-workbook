Day1

During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

Today I worked on the server and found myself bouncing around the files too much. I realized that I needed to take a step back and structure my time and thoughts more so I cound follow a flow and get more accomplished.
