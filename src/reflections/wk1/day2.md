# Day 2 -Html/CSS

## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use? 

> A **Pseudo-Class** is a keywork selector that selects an specific element(s) in a specific state. 

+ button:hover{
    color: Whatever color I want;
  }
+ :root

+ :not()

## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

> **Specificity** allows you to assign a hierarchy to the order in which rules and lines in a code will run by assigning vales to specific areas of code you want to target. Higher specificity will override other lower specificity text.

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

> Over using **!important** can throw off the flow of the CSS hierarchy and make it harder to manage the code.
