# Day 4 Wire-framing




What I learned today

## What is the purpose of wire-framing?
> Wire framing is a basic two dementional outline/structure of a project that allows everyone to be on the same page and agree on page layout and design before the developers build out the interface.

Dribble Behance are great sites for inspration.


## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
> Low-fidelity- this is the bare bones completely basic layout of a page, including only blocks, shapes and mok content. It can be scketched out very quickly to show the basic concept and work out any immediate issues with design layout.
> Med-fidelity- Most commonly used and gives a bit more detail to specific components withon the layout. There is clear definition and often varying weights are used in text to seporate content, these are usually created digitally.
> High-fidelity- Most detailed using pixle specifc layouts, actual featured images and relevent written content. This is ideal for exploring interactive features and menu systems.


## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not? 
> I think wireframing is an amazing tool that can not only give you the framework to start but also save tons of time in the development stages while also allowing you to create a user conscious page.
