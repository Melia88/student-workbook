# Day 1 - Intro Codeworks

What I learned in coding school is how to code.



## Why do we use Git?
>**Git** tracks and stores content and content change history, usually code, locally as well as on each developers personal computer. This system allows multiple developers to work on a project without coding conflicts and gives them the ability to revert back to a past version of the code if necessary

## The benefits of having multiple branches?
>Using **multiple branches** allows developers to create test code in parallel to the main code being written and allows the seporate code versions to be merged into one code

## Git VS GitHub Whats the difference?
> **Git** stores content on a local repository and on the local server. 
>
> **GitHub** stores content to a remote repository online that other developers can access and modify
