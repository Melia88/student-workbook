Read Advancing with Vue 3 > Pair Programming and answer the following questions

What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
>Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the "driver", the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the "navigator"; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so.

What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
>"Programming out loud" leads to clearer articulation of the complexities and hidden details in coding tasks, making it less likely to have errors.
>Helps the team learn, if on knows more than the other it can be helpful to get everyone on the same page.

What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
>Both people must be active in the coding project for it to be benificial.
>Its not helpful if the programmers, at least the driver, arent talking to eachother throughout the process.
>Pair programming cannot be fruitfully forced upon people, especially if relationship issues, including the most mundane (such as personal hygiene), are getting in the way; solve these first!
