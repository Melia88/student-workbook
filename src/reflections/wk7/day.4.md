Afternoon Challenge https://melia88.github.io/kanban/

Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
>We program out loud and it helps a ton. 

What went well?
> I think we communicated very well, stayed on task and had a plan that we would make at the end of every time box and would revisit at the begining. We both contributed eaqually and explained to eachother when we didnt understand. Neither of us got frustrated with the other and we were both fine with asking clairifying questions.

What would you do differently?
> I would be more active in the organizational aspect of the planning because I struggle with making a plan which can cause me to feel like I'm going into a project blindly and cause overwhelm.
