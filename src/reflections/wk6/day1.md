Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Understanding Component Based Architecture and answer the following questions
What is Component based architecture?
>a method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface (aka components) into self-sustaining, independent micro-systems.

What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
>The independent nature of components allows for developers to create a UI with many different moving parts. Because components are independent, one component can refresh without affecting other components or the UI as a whole. Components contain all of the features within a single class meaning developers don't have to spend much time trying to find which functions pertain to which parts of an application's UI. Components are also reusable but still allow different copies of those features to act independently.

What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
>Readability might actually become degraded and the view can be bloated and polluted.
