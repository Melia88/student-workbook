Read Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small teams

How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
> Scrum for a small team can result in not enough time coding if all meetings are done like they would be in a larger team so this means that at times smaller teams will need to adapt and do in between online type meetings while theyre working so they can get as much ironed out before any meetings that absolutly have to take place, such as ones with stake holders.

Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
> This is because generally while it is adaptible to smaller teams, larger teams are expected so its better to do one sprint at a time in this case so wveryone is on the same page and you dont run into issues.

What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
>Good service Cheap won't be Fast. Good service Fast won't be Cheap. Fast service Cheap won't be Good.
Understanding the tradeoffs on each side of the unattainable triangle allows a project team as a whole to set and accept realistic expectations. We leveraged this concept to work with the project's key stakeholders to clearly define and agree on the priorities for each of the workstreams.
