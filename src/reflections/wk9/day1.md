Day1

Daily Challenge 

Reflect on your capstone project so far and answer the following questions

What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

What went well so far?
I think that we've done a good job planning and have been trying to communicate openly. We have some different personalities and it can be hard but we are all working on keeping everyone on the same page and working together. 

What would you do differently? Why?
