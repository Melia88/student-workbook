What is an SSL certificate?
>SSL certificates are a small data files that cryptographically establish an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. That link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browser remain private.

>Extended Validation (SV) SSL are the most expensive SSLs to obtain, but they are valuable in showing the legitimacy of your domain from the address bar.
>Organization Validated (OV SSL) certificate verifies that your organization and domain validation are real.
>The Domain Validation (DV) certificate offers a low level of encryption shown as a green padlock next to the URL in the address bar.
>Wildcard SSL Certificates are in the "domain and subdomain number" category. Wildcard SSLs ensure that if you buy a certificate for one domain, you can use that same certificate for subdomains.
>Unified Communications certificates (UCCs) allow multiple domain names to be on the same certificate. UCCs were created to bridge communication between a single server and browser but have since expanded to include multiple domain names by the same owner. These are also known as Multi-domain SSL certificates.
>Single Domain SSL protects one domain. The thing to remember about this certificate is that you can't use it to protect subdomains or a completely different domain.
